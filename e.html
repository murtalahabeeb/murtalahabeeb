  <p>Drake's father, Dennis Graham is reportedly looking for love and he might be taking his search for a soulmate to a reality show. 

 

Sources told TMZ that the rich, single father of the successful Canadian rapper is in serious talks to land a show chronicling his search for a soulmate and at least 2 TV networks have agreed he's quite the catch. 

 

Drake

 

If aired, viewers will be able to catch a glimpse of the benefits of being Drake's father which includes clubbing, driving expensive cars and many others. 

 

Dennis Graham has reportedly had several meetings with his partner and reality TV guru David Weintraub and it was further gathered that there's strong interest from Vice and WE tv. He's expecting a signed deal sometime next week.</p>

  A New York Strip club has invited Kanye West to bring his Sunday Service to their venue.


Sapphire Gentlemen's Club posted an invitation letter on Twitter, requesting for the rapper-turned-gospel singer to come to deliver a concert for entertainers and their service staff. 

 

Alongside the letter, they wrote: 'We have extended an offer to @kanyewest to deliver his faith-filled concert in a new venue, to a new audience of Gentlemen’s Club entertainers, service staff & more. We’d love to open the doors to our doors & have him & his choir grace us with their presence.'<br>

    Veteran rapper, Ruggedman has slammed Senator Elisha Abbo after being spotted in a viral video pledging his support for the bill to regulate social media. 

 

The lawmaker representing Adamawa North Senatorial District who spoke during the senate's plenary session on the bill titled ‘Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation 2019’ which recently passed its second reading, called for its quick passage into law on grounds of the country being consumed if the menace of fake news is not contained.

 

“The issue of fake news in this country, if it’s not regulated is a cancer waiting to consume all of us,” Abbo said.

“Even conventional media that are regulated are suffering from falsehood. If we cannot regulate the spread of falsehood, it will consume all of us tomorrow.”
